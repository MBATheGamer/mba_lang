# MBA Programming Language

A general-purpose programming language.

## Installation

* [download a pre-built binary](https://github.com/MBATheGamer/mba_lang/releases/latest)

A MBA Lang installation is composed of one thing:

The MBA Lang executable

In other words, you can unpack a release of MBA Lang anywhere, and then begin using it immediately. There is no need to install it globally, although this mechanism supports that use case too (i.e. /usr/bin/mba).

## Building from Source

Ensure you have the required dependency:

* Go >= 1.5

Then it is the standard Go build process:

```sh
go build
```
